# Craft CMS Redirect Manager
**Note**
This is a fork of the original redirect plugin by Dolphiq with efforts to better 
maintain and support it. The codebase has been overhauled to have minimal impact on
the website when not in use. 404s are now registered in the database and matched via
regular expressions rather than application routes. This means your dynamic route 
format will have changed from the previous version of the plugin. 

Additionally, the registered 404s has been rebuilt to better handle more numerous entries.

## Updating form Dolphiq Redirect
You can migrate directly from Dolphiq Redirect to Venveo Redirect. [Please see the migration guide](MIGRATING.md) 

## Requirements
This plugin requires Craft CMS 3.1.19 or later - also tested on 3.2 alpha.
